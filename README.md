A todolist used for learning EJS and, later, database/persistence

This is part of Angela Yu's Web Development course. This project was used to learn EJS/templating in an earlier draft. Later, Mongo database was added using Mongoose's modeling tools to create persistence. In addition to the default To-Do List, the user has the ability to create custom lists by appending a name of the list at the end of the URL (ex. "/Work").All code was created on Node.js framework.
